            The ability of one class to inherit from another is a key
            advantage of object-oriented programing.
        </p>

        <p>
        If we have several classes that have various attributes and
        functionality (i.e. fields and methods) in common, it can be convenient
        to put all the things that they share into a single class and have the
        other classes "inherit" the things they have in common from that 
        new class. The fact that we only have to write the parts the classes
        have in common once leads many people to identify the main benefit of
        inheritance as code reuse.
        </p>

        <p>
        We will see that another very important advantage of inheritance is
        that it makes it easier to create a collection (e.g. vector) that can
        group together instances of our different classes.
        </p>

        <p>
        Let's look at an example: Suppose we have a number of classes that
        represent different types of animals. Certainly they must have a lot in
        common.  If we take all that they have in common and put it in a single
        class Animal, then the other classes (Lion, Tiger, Bear, etc.) will be
        much simpler to write.
        </p>

        <p>
        When we discuss inheritance, we say that the class that contains all
        the common information is the <b>base</b> or <b>parent</b> class.  The
        classes that inherit from the base (or parent class) are called
        <b>derived</b> or <b>child</b> classes. An inheritance hierachy can be
        multiple levels. If it is, we might also refer to an ancestor class or
        a descendant class.
        </p>

        <p>
        Inheritance is sometimes referred to as an IS-A relationship, because
        effectively any derived object is a base object, in the sense that
        anywhere you could use a base object, you should also be able to use
        any of the derived objects. (This is also known as Liskov's
        <b>Substitutability Principle</b>.) Sometimes people refer to IS-A as a test.
        If you cannot comfortably say: "My derived class <i>is a</i> base
        class", then something maybe wrong in your design. Using our example
        above of animals, we can say "a cat is a(n) animal," which helps verify
        that the Animal hierarchy makes sense.
        </p>

        <p>
        Sometimes it is good to compare the IS-A relationship with the HAS-A
        relationship. In a HAS-A relation, one object has (or contains) an
        instance of another. Occasionally people will confuse the two. For
        example, which should we use for the relationship between a point and a
        circle? In some sense, you might view a circle as a point that has the
        added attribute of a non-zero radius. But could we substitute a circle
        anywhere we would use a point? Is a line defined by two circles?
        Doesn't sound good. On the other hand, a circle certainly has a point
        that defines where its center is. Thus, representing a circle as having
        a field that is a point sounds better than saying that a circle is a
        point.
        </p>

    <p>
        <b>A few more notes...</b> 
    </p>

    <p>
    When creating a derived class, you need to specify
    <i>public</i> inheritance, as classes are private by default. No, you will
    never use private inheritance. Everything that is public in the base class
    becomes private in the derived.
    </p>

    <p>
    All methods and fields from the base class are inherited by the derived.
    However, all fields private in the base can only be accessed by the base's
    methods. When initializing an instance of the derived class, such fields
    <i>must</i> be initialized by the base constructor and cannot be initialized
    without it. Lucky for us, the derived class constructors will always call a
    base constructor, even if you do not specify a specific one. When
    constructing a derived instance, the base portion will get constructed
    first, at the start of the initialization list, before any unique derived
    fields are initialized.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>The Slicing "Problem"</b>: You <i>can</i> assign a derived object to a base
    object. However, any methods and fields unique to the derived will be lost.
