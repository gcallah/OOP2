        To change directories in the command line, we use cd. <br>
        cd: change directory <br>
        In the command line, type ‘cd’ followed by the path to a directory. For example, if I want to go to a repo called StudentOOP located in Documents/GitHub, I would type: <br>
        <span class="code"> cd Documents/GitHub/StudentOOP </span> <br>
        <br>
        To see a list of all files in your current directory, type in <br>
        <span class="code"> ls </span> <br>
        To see more information about each file, type <br>
        <span class="code"> ls -l </span>

                If your local repo is behind the one on GitHub, it will update the local repo without you having to clone the repo again.

                ***Since you will be the only one changing your repo in this class, you shouldn’t have to pull if you only commit and push from your computer using a command line or though GitHub Desktop. However, it is good practice to pull before committing and pushing, as this is very important when working in a repo with multiple contributors.

                We will be using the makefile to run our programs. It will be different depending on what the rule is called, but will be in the form of <span class="code"> make RULE_NAME </span>. For example, for the first assignment, typing <span class="code"> make hello </span> into the Terminal will compile the code. It would generate an executable file “test_hello” under the tests folder. In this class, all the executable files will be automatically created under the tests folder when you use make to compile the code.

            </li>

            <li>
                Run this executable file by typing <span class="code"> ./tests/test_hello </span> into the terminal window. If your current directory is tests, you just type <span class="code"> ./test_hello </span> to run the program.
            </li>

            <li>
                You will see “hello world!” in the command window.

            <li>
                If there are new files you want to add to the GitHub repository, you must let GitHub know you want to track them. Do this by typing
                    <span class="code"> git add FILE NAME </span>
                on the command line. DO NOT ADD FILES YOU DON’T WANT TO BE PUSHED TO GITHUB!!!
            </li>

            <li>
                To commit all the changes you’ve made to tracked files, type:
                <span class="code"> git commit -a -m “COMMIT MESSAGE” </span>
            </li>

            <li>
                The commit message should be a message that tells people something about the changes you’ve made.
            </li>

            <li>
                After committing your changes, type:
                <span class="code"> git push </span>
                or
                <span class="code"> git push origin master </span>

            <li>
                ***Sometimes, when you run git push, you may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. Notice when you type your password, it does not show up on the screen. That’s for privacy purposes. Just finish typing your password and hit enter.
            </li>

            <li>
                Note: The makefile provides a shortcut to do the step 4 and 5 (commit the changes and push to remote repo). You could type the command “make prod” into the terminal, which runs those commands for you.

                If you cannot find the repo, find the option to clone a repo.

        In Xcode version 9.0 and above, there is an option to run simple git commands within Xcode. First, you must connect Xcode with a GitHub account. There are two ways you can do this; in one way you login through the settings in Xcode, the other way occurs when you try to use the git commands and a login box is prompted to you.
        <br><br>
        Logging in Through Settings:
        <ol>

            <li>
                Open Xcode and under the Xcode tab, press the preferences option.
            </li>

            <li>
                From there press the Accounts tab. It should look something like this:
            </li>

            <li>
                Press the + sign on the bottom left corner and select the option for “Github” (NOT GITHUB ENTERPRISE)
            </li>

            <li>
                Login with your GitHub account and now you can use git commands through the tabs on Xcode
            </li>

        </ol>
        </p>
        <p><br>
        Logging in Through The Prompt:
        <ol>

            <li>
                Try to do a git command under the Source Control tab and they’ll prompt you to login if you have not done so already.
            </li>

        </ol>
        </p>
        <p><br>
        Using Git Commands in Xcode: <br>
        Make sure you are doing this in a xcode project that has a Git repo linked to it (by linked I mean you did the steps under “
            <a href="github.html#GitHubXcode"> Opening an Xcode Project on a GitHub Repo </a>
            ”) if you are trying to push / commit to an existing repo.
        <ol>

            <li>
                Under the “Source Control” tab, it lists some git commands you can use in Xcode.
            </li>
            <img src="images/GitHubNotes/XcodeGit1.png" width="250px">
            <li>
                Make sure to pull to get any new changes from your Git repo that your local copy of the repo may not have.
            </li>

            <li>
            Make sure to commit before you push.
            After pressing the Commit option, make sure that only the files you want to get pushed into the online Git repo gets checked in the left-side bar (EX. you don’t want to check off DS_STORE files since you do not need them in your repo + you do not want your executables in the Git Repo).
