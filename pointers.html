            Pointers in C++
        </h1>

        <p>
        Pointers (variables that contain a memory address)
        are a topic you will never have dealt with in a course based
        on a language like Python, thus they made be a hard concept to grasp.
        Nevertheless, they are fundamental to computer programming: you just
        never dealt with them in Python because Python hides their existence
        from the Python programmer... not deceitfully, but because it easier to
        program without having to think about memory addresses. But the people
        who create the Python language have to deal with pointers all the time.
        And you will never be a top-notch professional, even programming in a
        language that hides its pointers from you, unless you understand their
        use.

        <p>
        Here are the topics we will cover in this unit:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Addresses
            </li>

            <li>
                Pointer types
            </li>

            <li>
                Pointers and const
            </li>

            <li>
                Dynamic memory
            </li>
        </ul>
