            Recursion
        </h1>

        <p>
        Recursion happens when a function calls itself. The function is called
        a recursive function. Recursive functions do a small part of the task
        in each recursive call, similar to a loop. Note: recursion and looping
        are <b>not</b> the same. Most of the time, recursion can simplify your
        code and make algorithms easier to understand. However, there are also
        some cases where using recursion makes your program confusing and
        inefficient.

            The Three Parts of a Recursive Function
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                A base case
            </li>

            <li>
                A recursive call on a smaller data set; and
            </li>

            <li>
                Some work at each level
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        When writing a recursive function, there should always be at least one
        base case. This is necessary to tell the function when to stop the
        recursion and what to do at the end of the recursive calls. For most
        recursive functions, this is usually done with an if statement checking
        to see if one of the parameters reaches a certain value. For instance,
        if we are recursively calculating the factorial function, we check
        to see if our argument is 1, in which case we just return 1, rather
        than making a recursive call.
        </p>

        <p>
        Each recursive step should do a small portion of the overall task. This
        is similar to the body of a loop. The small portion of the task could
        be done before you call the function again, or afterwards.
        </p>

        <p>
        A recursive function would, of course, have at least one recursive
        call. The function calls itself, but with
        new parameters. In general, a parameter should get closer to the base
        case with each recursive call so that it will eventually reach the base
        case. If there is a non-void return type for the function, you have to
        make sure you return the recursive call.
        </p>

        <p>
        One way of writing recursive functions is to assume the function works
        on a smaller scale of the problem. Assuming
        the function does what it's supposed to on
        the next recursive call, what do we need to add to make it complete?
        For example, if we are recursively summing a data structure, and
        we assume the call <span class="code">sum(n - 1)</span> worked, what
        else do we need to do? Well, add <i>n</i> to that sum, of course!
        So we would write: <span class="code">return n + sum(n - 1)</span>
        </p>
