            Running our code from Cygwin
        </h1>

        <p>
        For Windows users, an easy way to get our homework build pipeline
        working is to install Cygwin, and then use the make commands we provide
        to build and push your programs. So let's look at how you can do this!
        </p>

        <p>
        The Cygwin install page
        <a href="https://cygwin.com/install.html">is here</a> .
        When you do the install, you should choose to install the following
        packages:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                gcc-g++
            </li>

            <li>
                git
            </li>

            <li>
                make
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        (You may install as many additional packages as you want, but those are
        sufficient.)
        </p>

        <p>
        You will then find a directory names something like 
        <span class="code">cygwin64</span> on your C: drive. You can then open
        that, and find a
        <span class="code">home</span>
        directory, and in that, a directory with
        your user name. You should <span class="code">cd</span> into that
        directory. Once there, you should clone you StudentOOP repo... run:
        </p>

        <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
            git clone your_repoURL.git
            </pre>
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>
        "your_repoURL.git" is not what you literally type in! We mean put in
        the URL of your StudentOOP repo! You can copy that from GitHub using
        the green "Clone or download" button.
        </p>

        <p>
        That should create a new directory (folder) called StudentOOP. You can
        the <span class="code">cd</span> into that, and then run:
        </p>

        <p>
        <code>
            <pre>
            make prod
            </pre>
        </code>
        </p>
