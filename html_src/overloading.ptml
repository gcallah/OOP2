            Operator Overloading
        </h1>

        <p>
        Operator
        <a href="glossary.html#overloading">overloading</a>
        creates multiple definitions for the same operator. So we can have
        the '[]' operator do the equivalent of array indexing for a
        <span class="code">vector</span>, while having it do a hash table
        access for a <span class="code">map</span>.
        Operator overloading takes place through the special syntax
        <span class="code">operator@</span> (where @ represents the operator
        being overloaded).
        </p>

        <p>
        Most C++ operators can be overloaded. The exceptions are:
        :: (scope resolution), . (member access), .* (member access through
        pointer to member), and ?: (ternary conditional).
        </p>

        <p>
        In addition, = (assignment), () (function call), [] (collection
        access), and -&gt; (member access through pointer) <i>cannot be
            non-member</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Other than the operators which <i>must</i> be class members, when
        should we make an operator a class member and when not?
        The general rule of thumb is:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Class member</span>:
                unary operators and non-symmetrical binary operators.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Not class member</span>:
                symmetrical binary operators.
            </li>
        </ul>
