            What are iterators?
        </h3>

        <p>
            Iterators are objects that allow access to the data
            structure with which they are associated, in a standard
            way. Typically, that access is sequential, although
            <span class="code">RandomAccessIterator</span> also
            is available.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is a video discussing the general idea of iterators...
            the code is in Java, but it is a good explanation of what
            iterators are <i>for</i>, whatever language we are
            using them in:

            Ranged for loops with iterators
        </h3>

        <p>
            In our course, we will mainly use iterators to allow
            the implementation of ranged-for loops for collections. 
            For this, our iterator class should include 3 parts:
            an equality operator, dereference operator, and the ++
            operator. The iterator should also store a data pointer 
            to the current object and have a constructor.
        </p>

        <h3>
            begin and end
        </h3>
        <p>
            The collection that utilizes the iterator should have 2 other
            methods: <span class="code">begin()</span> and <span
                class="code">end()</span>.
            <span class="code">begin()</span> should return an iterator
            that points to the memory address of the first element 
            of the collection and <span class="code">end()</span>
            should return the memory address after 
            the memory address of the last element of the address. 
            <span class="code">begin()</span>
            and <span class="code">end()</span> define a 
            half-open range which is 
            inclusive on the side of <span class="code">begin()</span>
            and exclusive on <span class="code">end()</span>. 
            Once you reach the <span class="code">end()</span>, 
            you know that you are out of bounds and should stop. 
        </p>

        <h3>
            Declaring STL iterators
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you import an STL container (for example in the line "
            <span class = "code">#include &ltvector&gt</span>"),
            you can call its 
            iterator by writing <span class = "code">"::iterator"</span>
            after the STL object. 
            For example, <span class = "code">"vector&lt char &gt::iterator"
            </span>.

            <br />
            <br />

            If you need a const iterator (so that you can treat 
            the item the iterator points at as const), 
            <span class = "code">"::const_iterator"</span>
        </p>
