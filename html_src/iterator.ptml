            Iterators

        <p>
            Iterators are objects similar to pointers in the 
            way that they point to other objects; however the
            main difference between iterators and pointers is 
            that iterators is its own class and can be bi-directional 
            if you implement your iterator class to do so.

        <p>
            In our course, we will mainly use iterators to allow
            the implementation of ranged-for loops for our classes. 
            For this, our iterator class should include 3 parts:
            an equality operator, dereference operator, and the ++
            operator. The iterator should also store a data pointer 
            to the current object.
