            Iterators

        <h3>
            What are iterators?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Iterators are objects similar to pointers in the 
            way that they point to other objects; however the
            main difference between iterators and pointers is 
            that iterators is its own class and can be bi-directional 
            if you implement your iterator class to do so. 

        </p>
        <h3>
            Ranged for loops with iterators
        </h3>
        <p>
            In our course, we will mainly use iterators to allow
            the implementation of ranged-for loops for collections. 
            For this, our iterator class should include 3 parts:
            an equality operator, dereference operator, and the ++
            operator. The iterator should also store a data pointer 
            to the current object and have a constructor.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Begin() and end()
        </h3>
        <p>
            The collection that utilizes the iterator should have 2 other
            methods: begin() and end(). Begin() should return an iterator
            that points to the memory address of the first element 
            of the collection and end() should return the memory address after 
            the memory address of the last element of the address. 
            You can think of begin() and end() as defining a 
            half-open range where it is 
            inclusive on the side of begin() and exclusive on end(). 
            Once you reach the end(), 
            you know that you are out of bounds and should stop. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Declaring STL iterators
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you import an STL container (for example in the line "
            <span class = "code">#include &ltvector&rt </span>"), you can call its 
            iterator by writing <span class = "code">"::iterator"</span> after the STL object. 
            For example, <span class = "code">"vector&lt char &gt :: iterator"
            </span>.

            <br />
            <br />

            If you need a const iterator (so that you can treat 
            the item the iterator is pointed to as const), 
            <span class = "code">"::const_iterator"</span>
        </p>
        <br />
