            Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
        </h1>

        <p>
            The following are the most fundamental reasons for adopting OOP:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Abstraction</span>
                <br />
                We can hide the particulars of the implementation of some type
                behind the public interface to a class.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Inheritance</span>
                <br />
                We can create a hierarchy of classes, in which the methods of
                an "ancestor" class are inherited by a "descendant" class,
                unless they are over-ridden.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Encapsulation</span>
                <br />
                The data members associated with a class can be hidden from
                view outside the class, so that they can only be accessed and
                altered through the public interface of the class.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Polymorphism</span>
                <br />
                Given that a function has a parameter of type A, it 
                can also accept as an argument any instance of a class
                descended from A. Furthermore, when it calls some method on A,
                the appropriate method of the descendant class will be called.
            </li>
        </ol>
