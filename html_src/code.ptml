            C++ Code Examples
        </h1>

        <p>
            The following code examples have been developed to help students
            studying object-oriented programming in C++. They are listed 
            <i>roughly</i> in the order a student will encounter these topics
            in learning C++ -- "roughly" because the exact order will always
            depend upon the student, the teacher, the textbook, and so on.
