        <p>
            C++ was originally called "C with classes." Classes are probably
            the most fundamental feature of object-oriented programming. So
            what is a class, and how is it different from a struct? When should
            we create a new class?
        </p>

        <p>
            The <i>technical</i> difference between a struct and a class in C++
            is that in a struct, everything is publically accesible by default,
            whereas in a class everything is private to the class by default.
            But, in fact, typically programmers use structs for instances where
            some data structure has no methods associated with it, and classes
            where there are methods.
