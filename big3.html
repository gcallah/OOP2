            Copy Control in C++
        </h1>

        <p>
        Copy control is a very important concept in C++ because it 
        involves the creation and deletion of objects (after 
        all, this course is called Object Oriented Programming). 
        You have dealt with constructors in Python but maybe it
        was not explicitly stated; every time you make an __init__ method 
        for your objects/class in Python, you have made
        a constructor for the object/class. 
        When you assign a class's name followed by parenthesis to a variable 
        in Python (for example if you have a class called
        <span class="code">BinarySearchTree</span> 
        and you write <span class="code">myObject = BinarySearchTree()</span>)
        you have called the class's constructor. 
        </p>

        <p>
        However, in C++, we take the creation of objects one step further; 
        we are now concerned about allocating and deallocating memory 
        because we directly tell the compiler through our code when and 
        how to allocate memory. 
        We did not have to worry about the deallocation of memory in Python 
        because Python automatically calls its 
        garbage collector when needed. 
        In C++ we often associate three language features
        with copy control:
        <a href="glossary.html#destructors">destructors</a>,
        <a href="glossary.html#copyconstructor">copy constructors</a>,
        and <a href="glossary.html#assignmentoperators">assignment
            operators</a>.
        We will call these the Big 3
        because often times 
        when you need to write any one of 
        them, you most likely will need to write the other two.
        </p>

        <p>
        Here are the topics we will cover in this unit:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="glossary.html#destructor">
                    Destructors
                </a>
                <br />
                    The purpose of the destructor is to destory items 
                    that are allocated onto the heap. The syntax follows that 
                    of the constructor except in the function 
                    name it starts with a tilde
                    followed by the class name.  
                <br />
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="glossary.html#copyconstructor">
                    Copy Constructor
                </a>
                <br />
                    The purpose of the copy constructor does 
                    what its name is; it 
                    creates a new object based on an existing object. 
                    The syntax for this
                    is the syntax for the constructor except an 
                    object of the same type
                    is passed in usually by constant reference. 
                    To "copy" the object,
                    you first allocate memory for the data members. 
                    Then you initialize 
                    those data members to be the same as the 
                    data members of the referenced 
                    object. 
                <br />
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="glossary.html#assignmentoperator">
                Assignment Operator
                </a>
                <br />
                    The purpose of the assignment operator is to 
                    set an existing object to be the 
                    same as another existing object of the same type. 
                    It should first remove or delete the items
                    stored in the object's data members, 
                    allocate memory for the new 
                    items, then copy the other object's data 
                    members to the current object.
                    You should also check for self-assignment 
                    (assiging an object to itself) 
                    and at the end of the function, return the object. 
                <br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
        However, do note that we will have to take additional steps 
        in regards to copy control with inheritance, 
        which will be discussed when we reach the topic of inheritance.
