            Copy Control in C++
        </h1>

        <p>
        Copy control is a very important concept in C++ because it 
        involves the creation and deletion of objects (after 
        all, this course is called Object Oriented Programming). 
        You have dealt with constructors in Python but maybe it
        was not explicitly stated; every time you make an __init__ method 
        for your objects/class in Python, you have made
        a constructor for the object/class. 
        When you assign a class's name followed by parenthesis to a variable 
        in Python (for example if you have a class called
        <span class="code">BinarySearchTree</span> 
        and you write <span class="code">myObject = BinarySearchTree()</span>)
        you have called the class's constructor. 
        </p>

        <p>
        However, in C++, we take the creation of objects one step further; 
        we are now concerned about allocating and deallocating memory 
        because we directly tell the compiler through our code when and 
        how to allocate memory. 
        We did not have to worry about the deallocation of memory in Python 
        because Python automatically calls its 
        garbage collector when needed. 
        In C++ we often associate three language features
        with copy control:
        <a href="glossary.html#destructors">destructors</a>,
        <a href="glossary.html#copyconstructor">copy constructors</a>,
        and <a href="glossary.html#assignmentoperators">assignment
            operators</a>.
        We will call these the Big 3
        because often times 
        when you need to write any one of 
        them, you most likely will need to write the other two.
        </p>

        <p>
        Here are the topics we will cover in this unit:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Destructors
            </li>

            <li>
                Copy Constructor
            </li>

            <li>
                Assignment Operator
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        However, do note that we will have to take additional steps 
        in regards to copy control with inheritance, 
        which will be discussed when we reach the topic of inheritance.
