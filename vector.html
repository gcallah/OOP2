            Vector Class Implementation
        </h1>

        <p>
        Now that we have learned how to do copy control, 
        how to create a class, 
        and how to use pointers, let us create one of 
        the very first class we used:
        <a href="glossary.html#vector"> vectors </a>. Let us begin to create this class.
        </p>

        <p>
        First off, what is a vector? In the past, 
        we know that we used vectors to store
        a collection of data. We also know that
         we used various methods (such as 
        <span class = "code">push_back, pop_back, etc.... 
        </span>).
        A vector is 
        composed of 3 main parts: 
        a data pointer pointing to an array, 
        something to keep track of the size, and 
        something to keep track of the capacity 
        (note that size and capacity are 
        not the same; the capacity is how much 
        data the collection can hold at present, the size
        is how much data the collection currently holds). 
        In order to create our vector, we will then
        need to have these 3 items in our constructor. 
        We will also need to recreate 
        the vector methods that we used before 
        for our own vector class. In other words,
        we will create our own vector class by using 
        the same  vector method names but we will
        supply our own function bodies to them. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Here are some of the items we will need to implement:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Dynamic Arrays
            </li>

            <li>
                Constructor 
            </li>

            <li>
                Big 3 (Copy Control)
            </li>

            <li>
                Vector methods (
                    <span class = "code">push_back, pop_back, clear, etc... 
                    </span>
                )
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        You might be wondering, "hey we can make vectors 
        that hold any type. How 
        do we do that?" We do not want to create 
        a data pointer with all the different
        types because it is space inefficient. Also, there is another problem:
        how will also account for pointers to 
        new classes we want to make? In other 
        words, we do not want to recreate the same vector methods to account 
        for all the classes we will use in for our vector.
        The easy way of doing this will be discussed 
        in the further topic of templates.
