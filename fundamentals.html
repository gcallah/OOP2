            Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
        </h1>

        <p>
            The following are the most fundamental reasons for adopting OOP:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Abstraction</span>
                <br />
                We can hide the particulars of the implementation of some type
                behind the public interface to a class. In C++ we
                can abstract even further using templates.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Inheritance</span>
                <br />
                We can create a hierarchy of classes, in which the methods of
                an "ancestor" class are inherited by a "descendant" class,
                unless they are over-ridden.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Encapsulation</span>
                <br />
                The data and the code associated with some type are
                packaged together (encapsulated), 
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Data Hiding</span>
                <br />
                The data members of a class can be hidden from
                view outside the class, so that they can only be accessed and
                altered through the public interface of the class.
                This property is closely associated with abstraction and
                encapsulation. (We need encapsulation to achieve data hiding,
                and it is partly through data hiding that we achieve
                abstraction.)
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="hilight">Polymorphism</span>
                <br />
                Given that a function has a parameter of type A, it 
                can also accept as an argument any instance of a class
                descended from A. Furthermore, when it calls some method on A,
                the appropriate method of the descendant class will be called.
            </li>
        </ol>
