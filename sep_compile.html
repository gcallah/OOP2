        <h3> What is seperate compilation? </h3>
        <p>
        Seperate compilation is the process of compiling individual files that
        come together to make up a bigger idea. 
        For example, if you want to simulate 
        a college course, you can create an indivudal
        <span class = "code">teacher.cpp</span>,
        <span class = "code">student.cpp</span>, and an overall 
        <span class = "code">course.cpp</span> and 
        their corressponding header files 
        (or .h files) that will make up the idea of a course. 
        We seperate each class into
        its own file for four main reasons: 
        it removes clutter, the relationship
        between classes is more easily seen,
        we can divide up work among a team more easily,
        and it can speed up building a program.
        It removes clutter because every class is in 
        their individual file so not everything is in one 
        giant file. 
        The relationship between classes
        are more easily seen because you can delegate 
        what type of relationship each class
        has with each other by determing which header files 
        are included in each .cpp file.
        We can divide up work among a team more easily
        because we can assign different team members different
        files to work on.
        And it speeds up building a program because build
        managers like Make, Visual Studio, and XCode can
        re-compile only the .cpp files that have changed since the last
        compilation.
        </p>

        <p>
        The header file will just contain the method declarations
        for each class and each
        method (generally) will not have a
        body that shows what each method does.
         (We call these
        <a href="glossary.html#functionprototype">
         function prototypes</a>.)
         Then in the .cpp file we will give each method a body / definition 
         (remember to use forward 
        declaration to show which method of which class is being defined). 
        Note that default values are written in only the header file and the 
        initialization list for constructors are in the .cpp file. 
        </p>


        <h3> Include Guards</h3>

        <p>
        In your header files, make sure you are using include guards. 
        They compose of 3 lines:
        <br/>
        <span class = "code"> #ifndef </span> ...
        <br />
        <span class = "code"> #define </span> ...
        <br />
        <span class = "code"> #endif </span>
        <br />
        where you replace the "..." with the name of the header file 
        followed by an undercore then a h.
        For example, if you have <span class = "code"> Class.h </span>, 
        the corressponding include guards
        would be: 
        <br />
        <span class = "code"> #ifndef Class_h</span> 
        <br />
        <span class = "code"> #define Class_h</span> ...
        <br />
        <span class = "code"> #endif </span>
        <br />
        The first line of code says that if <span class = "code"> Class_h </span> 
        has not been defined,
        define <span class = "code"> #ifndef Class_h</span> 
        as the lines up to the 
        <span class = "code"> #endif </span> line. Else if 
        the file has already been defined, go straight to
        the <span class = "code"> #endif </span> line.
        </p>

        <h3> How do I do seperate compilation? </h3>

        <p>
            It is often recommended for beginners to put every class into 
            one file then once everything works, 
            they should break up each class
            into its own file. Once you get the hang of this, 
            slowly transition to immediately making each class their 
            own file for each assignment. 
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
            First create a new .cpp file and a new .h file 
            for each class. Remember 
            to put the include guards in the header files. 
            In your .cpp files, 
            remember to include the .h file. 
            </li>

            <li>
            Move the whole
            class into the .h file. 
            </li>

            <li>
            Copy the method signature / 
            definition as well as the 
            body to the .cpp file (remember to use forward declaration). 
            </li>

            <li>
            Now in your .h 
            file, remove the method bodies. 
            Make sure to check for default values and initialization
            lists in your .cpp and .h files and 
            make sure they are in the appropriate 
            places. In other words, make prototypes for the methods.
            </li>
        </ol>
