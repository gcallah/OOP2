        </h1>

        <p>
        Here are some important OOP/C++ terms:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a name="abstractclass">
                <span class="hilight">abstract class</span>:
                </a>
                a class with at least one 
                <a href="#purevirtual">pure virtual method</a>
                is called abstract, meaning it cannot be instantiated.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="assignmentoperator">
                <span class="hilight">assignment operator</span>:
                </a>
                overriding the assignment operator for a class changes what
                <span class="code">=</span> does when used with members of
                that class.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="baseclass">
                <span class="hilight">base class</span>:
                </a>
                a class that another class inherits from.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="big3">
                <span class="hilight">big 3</span>:
                </a>
                the main three elements of copy control: the assignment
                operator, the copy constructor, and the destructor.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="class">
                <span class="hilight">class</span>:
                </a>
                a C++ construct that can hold both data values and
                functions (called <i>methods</i>). It differs from a
                <i>struct</i> in that the members of a struct are public by
                default, while members of a class are private by default.
                In practice, coders most often use
                <span class="code">struct</span>
                when they don't intend to write any methods.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="compile">
                <span class="hilight">compile</span>:
                </a>
                turning source code into machine code.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="constructor">
                <span class="hilight">constructor</span>:
                </a>
                the class method that initializes an object of that class.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="copyconstructor">
                <span class="hilight">copy constructor</span>:
                </a>
                the class method that initializes an object of that class
                <i>when it is being copied from another instance of that
                    class</i>.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="delegation">
                <span class="hilight">delegation</span>:
                </a>
                giving programming tasks to the lowest-level object that can
                handle them. For example, if your <span
                    class="code">Department</span> class needs to print <span
                    class="code">Employee</span> objects, it delegates the task
                to the <span class="code">Employee</span> class, rather than
                containing code to print them itself.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="derivedclass">
                <span class="hilight">derived class</span>:
                </a>
                a class that inherits from another class.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="destructor">
                <span class="hilight">destructor</span>:
                </a>
                the class method that cleans up all dynamically allocated
                resources for an object of that class.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="dynamicbinding">
                <span class="hilight">dynamic binding</span>:
                </a>
                means that the language being used
                decides what method should be called in a particular case at
                runtime, rather than at compile time.
                (See <a href="#polymorphism">polymorphism</a>.)
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="exception">
                <span class="hilight">exception</span>:
                </a>
                a C++ error-handling technique that enables non-local transfers
                of control.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="explicit">
                <span class="hilight">explicit</span>:
                </a>
                a C++ keyword that turns off implicit use of some type
                conversion.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="functionprototype">
                <span class="hilight">function prototype</span>:
                </a>
                code that just shows the return type, parameter types,
                and <span class="code">const</span> status of a function,
                but does not include the body of the function (what it actually
                does).
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="functor">
                <span class="hilight">functor</span>:
                </a>
                an object designed to work like a function. In C++, this
                is achieved by overloading the <span class="code">()</span>
                operator.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="genericprogramming">
                <span class="hilight">generic programming</span>:
                </a>
                focuses on the creation of data structures and algorithms that
                can work with many different types. In C++, generic programming
                is supported by <a href="#template">templates</a>.
            </li>

            <li>

                <span class="hilight">keyword</span>:
                </a>
                one of a number of reserved strings in a language, that can't
                be used to name functions or variables. In C++, keywords
                include things like
                <span class="code">if</span>, 
                <span class="code">while</span>, 
                <span class="code">for</span>, 
                <span class="code">const</span>, 
                <span class="code">virtual</span>,
                and many more.
            </li>

                <a name="lambda">
                <span class="hilight">lambda</span>:
                </a>
                an anonymous function, also called a lexical closure.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="linker">
                <span class="hilight">linker</span>:
                </a>
                The program that pulls together several compiled files into a
                single, executable file.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="LSP">
                <span class="hilight">LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)</span>:
                </a>
                One should be able to substitute an instance of a derived 
                class wherever an instance of a base class is called for.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="memo-ization">
                <span class="hilight">memo-ization</span>:
                </a>
                storing results in
                some data structure rather than calculating them again and
                again.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="multipleinheritance">
                <span class="hilight">multiple inheritance</span>:
                </a>
                when a derived class inherits from more than one base class.
            </li>

                <span class="hilight">overloading</span>:
                </a>
                to create more than one function or operator with
                the same name, but a different type signature.
                For instance, <span class="code">+</span>
                can add two integers, but it can also 
                add two doubles or two strings.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="overriding">
                <span class="hilight">overriding</span>:
                </a>
                is to create a method in a derived class that replaces the
                behavior of a method with the same name and arguments
                in its parent class.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="passbyreference">
                <span class="hilight">pass-by-reference</span>:
                </a>
                a way of passing an argument to a function that gives the
                function direct access to the object being passed.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="passbyvalue">
                <span class="hilight">pass-by-value</span>:
                </a>
                passing an argument to a function by copying the object 
                used and handing the funciton only a copy of its value, not
                access to the original object.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="pointer">
                <span class="hilight">pointer</span>:
                </a>
                a variable that holds a memory address.
                In C++, pointers are typed.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="polymorphism">
                <span class="hilight">polymorphism</span>: </a>
                also called "dynamic binding." Polymorphism describes the
                ability, present in some languages, to accept a pointer or
                reference to a base-type object, and yet successfully invoke
                the proper method in a derived-class object being referenced.
                In C++, polymorphism can be turned on by using the reserved
                word <span class="code">virtual</span> on a method in a class.
            </li>

            <li>

                </a>
                the program that runs before the compiler and handles
                <span class="code">#include</span> and
                <span class="code">#define</span> directives.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="purevirtual">
                <span class="hilight">pure virtual method</span>:
                </a>
                a method with the "body" <span class="code">= 0</span>,
                used to indicate that only descendants that supply that
                method can actually be created.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a name="reference">
                <span class="hilight">reference</span>:
                </a>
                a "smarter" pointer-like object that is de-referenced each time
                it is used.

                what occurs when an instance of derived class B is
                assigned to a variable of base class A. The data members of B
                that are not in A get "sliced" off.

                the assignment of a type to a variable once, at compile time,
                rather than <i>dynamically</i>, at run time.
