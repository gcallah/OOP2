            Why Study C++?
        </h1>

        <p>
        Given how much easier things are likely to seem to you in a language
        like Python, why should we bother learning a "hard" language like C++?
        Here are some reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                "Easy" languages like Python are usually implemented in 
                "harder" languages like C++. (The main Python implementation
                is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython">CPython</a>,
                written in C.) Thus, to fully understand the easy languages,
                one must undersand the hard languages!
            </li>

            <li>
                A language like C++ also has many practical applications:
                it is dominant in the game industry, where performance is
                crucial, and is used extensively in embedded systems
                (such as the <a href="https://youtu.be/3SdSKZFoUa8">Mars
                    Rover</a>), and in the finance industry, in real-time
                trading software.
            </li>

            <li>
                Studying C++ aids in grasping many fundamental programming
                concepts, such as memory allocation, pass-by-value versus
                pass-by-reference, pointers, and how types are actually
                implemented.
